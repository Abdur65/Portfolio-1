    <h1>Family in Islam</h1>
    <div class="define-classi">
        <div class="define">
    <h3>A family can  be defined in the following ways:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A man and a woman coming together through a valid marriage constitute a family.</li>
        <li>A group of people who are related to each other either legally or biologically.</li>
    </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="classi">
            <h3>A family can be classified based on</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Authourity</li>
                <li>Residence</li>
                <li>Marriage</li>
                <li>Members of the family</li>
                <li>Family lineage</li>
                <li>Selection of bride and groom</li>

        <p>Based of members of the family, a family can be nuclear(seperate), joint or extended.
        <h3>Seperate Family:</h3>
        In this system every-one is responsible for his own immediate dependants. His income belongs to him and not to the family.
        <h5>Advantages of separate family:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>To ensure the privacy and sanctity of the marital relationship.</li>
            <li>To allow the couple to raise their children in accordance with their own values and beliefs.</li>
            <li>To avoid conflict and tension with extended family members.</li>
            <li>To give the couple more independence and autonomy.</li>
        </ul>
        This system may breed selfishness and meanness. Those who look upon mankind as if raised on a high pedestal feel that the whole of mankind is akin to the limbs of one body - humanity; but the Separate Family System turns brothers into strangers, who may meet several times a day but do not care for one another.
        <h3>Joint Family:</h3>
        This system implies that all members of a clan:- father, son, brother, sister, uncle, nephew etc., live together. The in come of the individual is not treated as his personal property, rather it belongs to the family and the expenses of all members are met by that 'family income.'
        <h5>Advantages of joint family:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Strengthens family ties:</strong> When multiple generations live together under one roof, they are more likely to spend time together and develop strong relationships. This can be especially beneficial for children, who can learn from the wisdom and experience of their elders.</li>
            <li><strong>Promotes traditional values:</strong> Joint families are often more traditional than nuclear families. This is because they typically have a more hierarchical structure, with the elders holding more authority. This can help to promote traditional Islamic values such as respect for elders and obedience to parents.</li>
            <li><strong>Provides support for older family members:</strong> In a joint family, older family members are not left to fend for themselves. They have the support of their children and grandchildren, who can help them with daily tasks and provide emotional support.</li>
            <li><strong>Creates a sense of community: </strong>Joint families often have a strong sense of community. This is because they are made up of people who are related by blood or marriage. This sense of community can be very supportive, especially in times of need.</li>
            <li><strong>Helps to raise children in a traditional setting:</strong> Children who grow up in joint families are more likely to be exposed to traditional Islamic values and practices. This can help them to develop a strong sense of their Islamic identity.</li>
        </ul>
        So much about its advantages. Ironically, these very advantages give rise to its disadvantages. The ease of mind provided by this system some times can be misused by some unscrupulous people. If a member of the family is lazy, he finds it easy enough to live on the fruits of others' labour; he never realizes the importance of earning his own livelihood. Once he acquires such taste, he will find many excuses to avoid work. After all, why should he exert himself when there are other relatives ready to take his burden on their shoulders?<br>
        Furthermore, this system kills the initiative to work harder. If a man exerts himself to the furthest limit and thus earns more, his standard of living, naturally, would be much higher than a person earning less. If a man earns twice as much as his brother, common sense says that their standards of living must be different accordingly. But the Joint Family System does not allow it. And the drive to exert oneself more, and to earn more, dies.

        <h3>Importance of Family Code</h3>
        <p>A sensible and well-balanced family system is the very foundation of a happy life. Indeed, it is the root of an advancing civilization. Religion comes to take human beings nearer to Allah. Therefore, it must create an atmosphere conducive to that ideal; otherwise, it cannot achieve its goal. No religion can be regarded as complete unless it has a well-defined code of family life which expressly shows the exact responsibility and role of each member of the family. The family is a closely-knit unit of human society; and this nearness creates eminent danger of friction and conflict unless every member is told in unambiguous terms what his duties and rights are. <br><br>
        In short, Islam has brought for mankind a Family System which combines the good features of both family systems mentioned earlier and has weeded out the evil aspects of both. It has the legal straight-forwardness of the Separate Family System as well as the harmony and sympathy of the Joint Family System.
